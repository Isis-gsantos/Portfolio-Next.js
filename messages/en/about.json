    "title": "About Me",
    "description": "From an early age, I have always been curious, and seeing people I admire following the path of technology, I decided to dive into front-end development.\n\n I started self-taught and quickly realized my aptitude, leading me to pursue a professional course to solidify my knowledge, from the basics to advanced practices.\n\n My goal is to continue advancing in my career, honing my skills and learning new technologies to become a complete professional and, eventually, a full-stack developer. Currently, I am learning MySQL.\n\n I am a classic nerd/geek, passionate about casual games, anime, movies, and animation series. I feel fulfilled being part of the development community, and although I have not yet worked in the field, I am ready to seize the next opportunity and give my best."
